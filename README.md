# Boids

This is a simple implementation of boids (flock simulation) made using the Godot Game engine. You can learn more about it on my [website](https://nando.pages.dev/post/boids/).

## Running the project

Make sure you have the **Mono-enabled** version of the Godot game engine installed, and then import the project.godot file.
